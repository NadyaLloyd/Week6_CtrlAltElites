    <h3 style="color:white">KEEP TRACK</h3>
    <p style="color:white">With Virtual Learning it can be difficult to keep track of all the little assignments, and although there are many task trackers available on your laptop/appstore, we will find a way to make our application unique to Loyola. The user will first list out their courses, then week by week will continuously update their assignments in the form of checklists. We will grant user satisfaction each time a task is completed (still figuring out what we want to do for that). The application will provide the user a simple, yet innovative platform to manage their workload.</p>
